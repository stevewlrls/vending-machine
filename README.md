# Vending Machine

This project illustrates the use of JavaScript 'modules', along with a simple configuration for the Parcel bundler.

Parcel is included as a 'dev' dependency, rather than assuming that it is installed globally.

If you clone this repository, run `npm install` to add the required Node modules and then `npm start` to view the result.
